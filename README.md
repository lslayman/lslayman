### Hi friend! I'm Lauren! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Denver-based Full Stack Software Engineer with a background in the nonprofit and healthcare industries. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading books, drinking craft beer, and watching a little too much TV (ideally I have a small animal on my lap while participating in any of the aforementioned activities).
