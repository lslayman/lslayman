### Welcome! I'm Lauren! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Denver-based Full Stack Software Engineer with a love of learning -- I'm pretty much always taking a course, reading a book, or listening to a podcast on something new.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a CLI version of "Baby Billy's Bible Bonkers" (as a fun little nod to The Righteous Gemstones)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis & Tableau
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite podcasts!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I come from a family of homebrewers and all-around beer lovers. Our family's house keeps 8 beers on tap at all times!
